How to Setup:

By default, Chestburster requires a mapcycle.txt file to change the maps properly. In the GitHub repo, I've provided separate mapcycles for CS:S and HL2DM maps, just put one of them in garrysmod/cfg or make your own.

Maps require chest spawns to be played on, since chests are essentially the core of the gamemode. To find out more about this, type chbu_help in console.


Inside of shared.lua contains a bunch of variables that are safe to configure to change the gamemode behavior to your liking. If you know a bit of lua, you should be able to add new entries to the powerup, element, trap and weapon tables as well.


Enjoy!
